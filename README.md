- pyresparser (NLP resume parsing)
- plotly (charts)
- gspread/pygsheets (optional, for Google Sheets integration)

```
- The app will open in your browser at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## Data Storage
- **Resume data** is saved to `User_Data.xlsx` in **Sheet1**
- **Feedback data** is saved to `User_Data.xlsx` in **Sheet2**
- The Excel file is created/updated automatically in your project directory
- Make sure to close the Excel file before submitting new data to avoid permission errors

## Customization
- To change the UI colors, edit the CSS blocks in `App/App.py`
- To add/remove fields saved to Excel, update the `resume_save_data` and `feedback_save_data` dictionaries
- To use Google Sheets instead of Excel, replace the `save_to_excel` function with a gspread-based function

## Accessibility

- The app uses high-contrast colors, readable fonts, and clear icons for all status messages.
- All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, dropdowns) are clearly visible and accessible.
- All screenshots in this README include alt text for screen readers.
- For further accessibility improvements, consider:
  - Using even larger font sizes for visually impaired users
  - Testing with a screen reader
  - Ensuring all color indicators are also represented by icons or text

## Known Issues / Troubleshooting

- **Excel Permission Error:**
  - If you see a 'Permission denied' error when saving to Excel, make sure the file is closed in Excel or any other program before submitting data.
- **Missing Dependencies:**
  - If you see errors about missing modules (e.g., openpyxl, pandas), install them with `pip install -r App/requirements.txt` and `pip install openpyxl`.
- **Large Excel Files:**
  - The admin dashboard paginates data for performance. If the file grows very large, consider archiving old data.
- **Resume Parsing Issues:**
  - If resume parsing fails, check that the PDF is not corrupted and is a standard, text-based PDF (not just scanned images).
- **Google Sheets Integration:**
  - Not enabled by default. See README for setup if you want to use it.
